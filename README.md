# Indaba Coding Challenge

Hey Courtney & Blake, great meeting you earlier this week! Shoot me an email if you have any questions or need additional information at alexandralaudon@gmail.com.

- Set up environment using Vagrant/Vibrantbox (specifically scotchbox) and SequelPro (even though I realized halfway through I didn't REALLY need it for this challenge - but it's always good to double-check my work).
- Magento Codebase is in here
- Once completed, the homepage will highlight featured categories.

I added an admin using
```sh
$ bin/magento admin:user:create --admin-firstname='hello' --admin-lastname='world' --admin-email='hello@world.com' --admin-user='alex' --admin-password='indaba-1-TEST'
```
